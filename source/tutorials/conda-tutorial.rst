Publishing your plugin on conda
###############################

Once you've `made your first qiime2
plugin </posts/2018/03/qiime2-plugin>`__, you'll need to build it into a
conda package and upload it to anaconda.org so others can easily install
it. This tutorial is intended for first-time python developers trying to
put their QIIME 2 plugin into conda.

In this tutorial, I'll be drawing on examples from my experience developing
the `q2-perc-norm <https://github.com/cduvallet/q2-perc-norm>`__ and `q2-dbotu <https://github.com/cduvallet/q2-dbotu>`__ plugins.

Quickstart
==========

1. Install ``conda`` and ``conda-build``.

2. Make the files that make up the conda recipe: ``meta.yaml``, which
   needs you to use your brain, and ``build.sh`` and ``bld.bat`` which you
   just copy from the internet.

3. Build your package with ``conda-build`` (including the additional channels
   needed for qiime2 dependencies).

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda-build pyinstrument/
           -c https://conda.anaconda.org/qiime2/label/r2018.4
           -c https://conda.anaconda.org/qiime2
           -c https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge
           -c defaults
           -c https://conda.anaconda.org/bioconda
           -c https://conda.anaconda.org/biocore
           --override-channels
           --python 3.5

4. Install your package locally.

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install --offline /path/to/file.tar.bz2

5. Try using your package (make sure you're in a qiime environment).

6. Upload to Anaconda.

    .. code-block:: bash

        anaconda upload /path/to/file.tar.bz2

7. Profit!

Documentation
=============

Before you start, here is some useful documentation to be aware of.

The conda tutorials are short and informative. You should read the
`tutorial using ``skeleton`` <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html>`__
first, then and then the tutorial on `building a package from scratch <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html>`__,
regardless of which way you plan to build your package.

Step by step process
====================

Install conda and conda-build
-----------------------------

Follow the
`instructions <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/build-packages/install-conda-build.html>`__
to install and update ``conda`` and ``conda-build``.

Read the tutorials
------------------

Even if you'll be making your package from scratch, start with the
`"building packages with skeleton"
tutorial <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html>`__
and then read the `"building packages from scratch"
one <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html>`__.

Make your conda recipe
----------------------

Packages are specified in a ``recipe``, which as far as I can tell means
"a collection of files that describe what the package needs and how to
install it." A detailed explanation of the files that you need can be
found
`in the conda building packages documentation <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/build-packages/recipe.html>`__.
The recipe is just three files: ``meta.yaml``, ``build.sh``, and
``build.bat``. The conda documentation and tutorials recommend putting these files in a directory called ``pyenvironment``.

-  ``meta.yaml`` - This contains all the metadata in the recipe, and is
   the part that you need to use your human brain to fill out.
   Specifically, you need to tell ``conda-build`` where to find the
   source code (either a local path or to a github release), and you
   also specify the requirements that your package needs. Also, if you
   want to build a platform-independent version of your package, you
   specify this in here too.
-  ``bld.bat`` - this file contains the Windows commands to build the
   package. You can copy it from the `conda "from scratch"
   tutorial <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html#writing-the-build-script-files-build-sh-and-bld-bat>`__.
-  ``build.sh`` - this file contains the macOS and Linux commands to
   build the package, i.e. just ``python setup.py install``. You can
   also copy it from the `conda "from scratch"
   tutorial <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html#writing-the-build-script-files-build-sh-and-bld-bat>`__.

meta.yaml
~~~~~~~~~

``meta.yaml`` is the workhorse of package building, and is where you
specify basically everything about your package. The `conda "building
packages"
documentation <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/build-packages/define-metadata.html>`__
explains all the parts of this file and gives examples.

For the anyone new to the ``yaml`` data format, note that the top-level
IDs in the file don't get filled out!

source
^^^^^^

This tells ``conda-build`` where to look for the code when it builds
your package. You can point to either a github release or to a local
path. Note that the way building a package works is that ``conda-build``
looks for the code specified in the ``source`` part of ``meta.yaml`` and
does some magic which produces a ``.tar.bz2`` file that contains your
package. This ``.tar.bz2`` file is the thing you upload to anaconda.org,
and which people download when they run ``conda install``. This means
that if you make changes to your code,
you have to manually re-build the package and re-upload it for those
changes to show up on conda.

So, for simplicity's sake, it's often easier to just point ``source`` to
the local path with your main package directory (i.e. the folder that
has your ``setup.py`` file). In this case, that looks like this:

::

    source:
      path: ../

But you can also point it to a github *release*, like in the conda
documentation example. You can find your releases (or make new ones) by
going to your repo on github.com, clicking on ``Release`` (in the same
bar as where your commits, branches, and contributors are shown), and
following the directions there.

An important note that if you make and push changes to your code and
re-build your package, ``conda-build`` will still be looking at whatever
*release* you point it to - so you need to make a new release with your
changes! (This cost me like an hour of debugging, d'oh!)

requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This part tells ``conda-build`` and ``conda`` what other packages your
package needs. You need to populate this section yourself. Note that if
you want to specify specific package versions, the syntax is
``package_name >=version``, with no space between the ``>=`` and the
version number.

`This requirements
section <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/build-packages/define-metadata.html#requirements>`__
can have multiple sub-sections, but as far as I can tell all you really
need (for a simple package, like a qiime2 plugin) are the ``build:`` and
``run:`` sections. The ``build`` section has whatever packages are in
your ``setup.py`` script (or whatever command is in your ``build.sh``
file), the ``run`` section has whatever packages you need to run your
package.

architecture-independent package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I don't know very much about what's going on here, but if you don't do
the following steps, your built conda package will only be installable
on machines that have the same OS as yours.

The QIIME 2 developers briefly explained it as follows in `response to one of my questions <https://forum.qiime2.org/t/package-uploaded-to-anaconda-but-not-installable/4139/3?u=cduvallet>`__:

::

    The `noarch package <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/build-packages/define-metadata.html#architecture-independent-packages>`__
    lets you upload one build that is compatible on multiple platforms -
    the caveat here is that it is up to you to know if that is the case
    or not.

To make architecture-independent package, also add this to your
``meta.yaml`` file:

::

    build:
        noarch: generic

If you do ``noarch: python`` instead, this indicates that your package
can use either Python 2 *or* 3 (and is also architecture-independent).

build files
~~~~~~~~~~~

There's no magic here if you already have a ``setup.py`` file, because
the ``build`` files just call whatever command you call to install your
package (e.g. ``python setup.py install``). The ``build.sh`` and
``bld.bat`` files are thus very simple, and can be copied from the
`conda "from scratch"
tutorial <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html#writing-the-build-script-files-build-sh-and-bld-bat>`__.

Note: these are instructions for if you have something simple that can
directly be installed with ``python setup.py install``. I have no idea
what happens if you have something more complicated that you need to do.

Build your package
------------------

Go to your repo's root directory, and run ``conda-build pyinstrument/``.
This assumes you put your ``meta.yaml`` and build files in a folder
called ``pyinstrument``.

If you're working on a qiime plugin, that probably won't work, because
you need to tell conda to look for dependencies in lots of different channels. Thankfully, the qiime2 `development
docs <https://dev.qiime2.org/latest/publishing/>`__ are helpful here!

To build a qiime2 plugin, the command you have to run is actually:

::

     conda-build pyinstrument/ \
      -c https://conda.anaconda.org/qiime2/label/r2018.4 \
      -c https://conda.anaconda.org/qiime2 \
      -c https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge \
      -c defaults \
      -c https://conda.anaconda.org/bioconda \
      -c https://conda.anaconda.org/biocore \
      --override-channels \
      --python 3.5

Install your package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `conda
documentation <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html#building-and-installing>`__
says you can now install your package with the ``--use-local`` flag:

::

    conda install --use-local pyinstrument/

However, this didn't work for me (it says that the package isn't found).
Rather than troubleshoot this, I found out that you can also install a
package directly from the ``tar.bz2`` file that you just made with the
``--offline`` flag in ``conda-build``.

If you go back to the output of your ``conda-build`` command, you should be
able to find the path that this ``.tar.bz2`` file was saved to.
Something like:

::

    /Users/claire/anaconda/conda-bld/osx-64/q2_perc_norm-1.0-py35_0.tar.bz2

So you can try to install the package directly from this:

::

    conda install --offline /Users/claire/anaconda/conda-bld/osx-64/q2_perc_norm-1.0-py35_0.tar.bz2

Ok, looks like that worked! Woooo!

Test your package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're a noob like me and didn't include any unit tests in your
package, you'll want to make sure that your package will actually work
once it's installed.

A note that if you're developing a QIIME 2 plugin, you probably want to
be in a new qiime environment so you don't mess things up too badly...
(If you've forgotten, like I have, go to the Quickstart dev docs to
remind yourself how to do this:
https://dev.qiime2.org/latest/quickstart/)

.. code:: bash

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiime2/environment-files/master/latest/staging/qiime2-latest-py35-osx-conda.yml
    conda env create -n qiime2-dev-condatest --file qiime2-latest-py35-osx-conda.yml
    source activate qiime2-dev-condatest

Then, you can just type in ``qiime`` to your command line and see if (1)
you get no errors and (2) your plugin shows up in the list of available
plugins.

Troubleshooting ``citations.bib`` error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The newest version of QIIME 2 allows plugin developers to include a
``citations.bib`` file which is used to automatically generate a list
of citations that any given workflow used. This is a great feature, since
it ensures that original methods developers get credit for their work!

However, included ``citations.bib`` in my ``plugin_setup.py`` file
led to an error after I installed my plugin.
If I tried to run anything with qiime
(e.g. ``qiime list``), I got an error that it can't find my
``citations.bib`` file. That's because I need to tell ``setuptools``
that it needs to grab additional data beyond just ``*.py`` files, which
it does automatically. Looking at the
`cutadapt <https://github.com/qiime2/q2-cutadapt/blob/master/setup.py>`__
plugin, looks like I just need to add this to ``setup.py``:

.. code:: bash

    setup(
        name="perc-norm",
        ...
        package_data={
            'q2_perc_norm': ['citations.bib']
        }
    )

(A small note: this file path should be given relative to the folder
which contains your ``plugin_setup.py``, not to the main repo. Here, my citations file
is in ``~/github/q2_perc_norm/q2_perc_norm/citations.bib`` and my
``setup.py`` file is in ``~/github/q2_perc_norm/setup.py``. If you
instead put
``package_data={'q2_perc_norm': ['q2_perc_norm/citations.bib']}`` in
``setup.py``, it won't find the right file and you'll keep getting the
same error.)

Now, I need to re-build and re-install and re-try.

If re-installing doesn't work, you might want to try clearing
everything: uninstall your plugin, clear all the conda-build previous
builds, and clear the conda cache. Then, try re-building, re-installing,
and re-trying.

.. code:: bash

    conda uninstall q2_perc_norm
    conda build purge
    conda clean --all

Another note that if the ``source`` in your ``meta.yaml`` points to a
github release of your code, you should re-point this to a release that
includes any changes you've made (i.e. if you've pushed changes to your
github repo, you need to make a new release which includes those
changes, and change the release that ``meta.yaml`` points to). This is
why pointing to a local path might reduce some headaches!

Upload it to Anaconda
=====================

Once you've successfully built and installed your plugin
and made sure that it works as expected, the last step is to upload it
to anaconda.

Following the `directions in the
documentation <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html#optional-uploading-packages-to-anaconda-org>`__
(after making an anaconda.org account), it's really easy:

.. code:: bash

    anaconda upload /Users/claire/anaconda/conda-bld/noarch/q2_perc_norm-2018.4.0-py35_0.tar.bz2

Install the package from conda
==============================

Your final step is to try installing the package from conda. Make sure
you've uninstalled any local versions that you have, and that you're not
in the package's directory when you try to ``conda install`` your new
package. You'll need to include your channel in the call to
``conda install``, but you can just copy and paste this from `your
package's installation
instructions <https://anaconda.org/cduvallet/q2_perc_norm>`__ on
anaconda.org.

If you're working on a qiime2 plugin, you'll want to make sure you're in
the qiime2 environment (otherwise, conda doesn't know where to find all
the qiime2-related modules and packages) and with the latest version of
qiime2.

.. code:: bash

    source activate qiime2-2018.4
    conda install -c cduvallet q2_perc_norm

Another "gotcha!" that got me is that if you want to see which packages
are available in your channel (i.e. your account), you can run this
command:

.. code:: bash

    conda search -c <your_channel_name>

Side note: including pip packages
=================================

If one of your requirements is a package on pip, you'll need to first
put it into conda before you can make your plugin conda-installable.
(From `this still open
issue <https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/548>`__ on conda,
seems like this is currently the only way!) This happened to me in
building my `distribution-based OTU
calling <https://github.com/cduvallet/q2-dbotu>`__ plugin.

Thankfully, if the package is already pip-installable, this shouldn't be
too difficult. ``conda skeleton`` can help you get started:

::

    conda skeleton pypi dbotu

This makes a folder called ``dbotu`` with a ``meta.yaml`` file in it.
Then, because it has the build command directly in the ``meta.yaml``
file, you can just try building a conda package from this directly:

::

    conda-build meta.yaml

Note that if you need to look in different conda channels for certain
requirements, this will break. You can fix it with something like:

::

    conda-build meta.yaml -c conda-forge

Then, go through the process of building, testing, and uploading your
package to anaconda.org. After that, you can get back to developing your
QIIME 2 plugin.
