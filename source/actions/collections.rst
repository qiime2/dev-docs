Collections
###########

Commands in QIIME 2 can take collections of Artifacts as singular inputs or return collections of Artifacts as singular outputs. They may also take collections of primitives as single parameters.

Registering an Action that Takes an Input Collection
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Input or parameter collections can be in the form of lists or dictionaries. For inputs the type annotation for function registration is the QIIME 2 semantic type of the Artifacts expected. For parameters it is just the type of the parameter.

An example of registering collection inputs and parameters is shown below. For a list input, the syntax is "List[SemanticType]" and for a dictionary it is "Collection[SemanticType]"

.. code-block:: Python

    dummy_plugin.methods.register_function(
        function=example,
        inputs={
            'int_list': List[SingleInt],
            'int_dict': Collection[SingleInt],
        },
        parameters={
            'bool_list': List[Bool],
            'bool_dict': Collection[Bool]
        },
        outputs=[
            ('return', Collection[SingleInt]),
        ],
        name='Example',
        description=('Example collection method')
    )

In the actual function definition, the type annotation is the view type of the Artifacts and does NOT contain the collection type annotation. The fact that they do not contain the collection type annotations is an implementation detail that may change in the future. The fact that the annotations indicate the view type and not the semantic type is due to the fact that by the time we reach the actual method "int_list" will be a list of integers and not SingleInt Artifacts.

.. code-block:: Python

    def list_of_ints(int_list: int, int_dict: int, bool_list: bool, bool_dict: bool) -> int:
        return int_list.extend(list(int_dict.value()))

Registering an Action that Returns an Output Collection
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Returning an output collection works much the same as returning anything else in QIIME 2. Using the same example method as earlier, you register your return as a Collection of the type of Artifact you are returning.

.. code-block:: Python

    dummy_plugin.methods.register_function(
        function=example,
        inputs={
            'int_list': List[SingleInt],
            'int_dict': Collection[SingleInt],
        },
        parameters={
            'bool_list': List[Bool],
            'bool_dict': Collection[Bool]
        },
        outputs=[
            ('return', Collection[SingleInt]),
        ],
        name='Example',
        description=('Example collection method')
    )

The return type annotation on the action itself is still the view type of the Artifacts within the collection.

.. code-block:: Python

    def list_of_ints(int_list: int, int_dict: int, bool_list: bool, bool_dict: bool) -> int:
        return int_list.extend(list(int_dict.value()))

In this instance, the value "ints" that is returned is a list, but it could also have been a dict. The actual QIIME 2 Result you get is a ResultCollection object which is essentially a wrapper around a dictionary. If the original return is a list, the ResultCollection uses the list indices as keys.

Using Collections on The CLI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On the CLI, output collections require an output path to a directory that does not exist yet. The directory will be created, and the Artifacts in the collection will be written to the directory along with a .order file that lits the order of the Artifacts in the collection.

These collections can then be used as inputs to new actions by simply passing that directory as the input path. You can also create a new directory yourself and place artifacts in it manually to use as an input collection. This directory may or may not have a .order file. If it does not contain a .order file, the artifacts in the directory will be loaded in whatever order the file system presents them in (not defined by us).

De-facto collections of parameters and inputs may also be created on the CLI by simply passing the argument multiple times. For example, the following will create a collection of foo.qza and bar.qza for the ints input.

.. code-block:: bash

    qiime plugin action --i-ints foo.qza --i-ints bar.qza

The collection will be loaded in the order the arguments are presented to the command line in so in this case [foo, bar] if ints wants a list or {'0': foo, '1': bar} if it wants a dict. You may also explicitly key the values like so.

.. code-block:: bash

    qiime plugin action --i-ints foo:foo.qza --i-ints bar:bar.qza

As you might imagine, this would look like {'foo': foo, 'bar': bar} internally if ints wanted a dict. If ints wanted a list, it would just strip the keys and be [foo, bar] again.

Using Collections in The Python API
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can just pass in a list or a dict and it follows the same rules as the CLI. Internally QIIME 2 will turn it into the collection type it needs. If it needs a dict but you gave it a list it will use list indices as keys. Going the other way, it will just strip the keys and make a list of the values.

The ResultCollection Object
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QIIME 2 outputs collections in the form of ResultCollection objects. On the CLI, these objects are handled internally, but in the Python API they must be interacted with directly. Fortunately, these objects are very simple.

A ResultCollection is basically just a wrapper around a dictionary that can be found at its "collection" attribute.

__init__
  Instantiating a ResultCollection object without any arguments will create a ResultCollection with an empty dictionary as its collection. Instantiating a ResultCollection with a dictionary as its argument will create a ResultCollection with that dictionary as its collection. Instantiating a ResultCollection with any other iterable will enumerate the iterable and use the indices as keys to the dictionary that is used as the collection.

load
  You can load a directory of Artifacts (an output collection from CLI for example) into a ResultCollection by calling ResultCollection.load('path to directory'). If this directory contains a .order file, the Artifacts will be loaded in the order specified in the .order file. Otherwise they will be loaded in the order the OS presents them in (not defined by us). The names of the files will be used as the keys to the Artifacts

save
  You can save your ResultCollection to disk by calling ResultCollection.save('path to destination') where the destination is a directory that does not exist yet. This will save all Artifacts in the collection to .qzas in the directory using their key as their name. It will also create a .order file in the directory that lists the keys in the collection in order.

Other than these methods, you may set and read values on a ResultCollection just the same as a dictionary, you may also call keys, values, and items on a ResultCollection in the same way as a dictionary. The validate method also exists on ResultCollection objects and will validate all Artifacts that are part of the collection.
