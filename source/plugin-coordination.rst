Coordinating With Other Plugins
===============================

There are several namespace considerations to keep in mind when developing
QIIME 2 :term:`plugins <Plugin>` or :term:`actions <Action>`.

- :term:`Plugin` names are unique, and collisions are not tolerated by the
  framework.  This means if you want to name your plugin ``dada2``, users will
  not be able to have your plugin **and** the
  https://github.com/qiime2/q2-dada2 plugin installed in the same
  :term:`deployment` at the same time.
- :term:`Action` names are **not** globally unique, but rather are namespaced
  within a plugin's domain.
- :term:`Semantic Types <Semantic Type>`, :term:`Formats <Format>`, and
  :term:`Transformers <Transformer>` are registered globally, like plugins,
  again, if you choose to use an existing name, this will prevent users from
  deploying both offending plugins concurrently.

There are a few strategies the QIIME 2 developers have employed to work within
these limits:

- Most :term:`types <Type>`, :term:`formats <Format>`, and :term:`transformers
  <Transformer>` are registered in a single :term:`plugin`: q2-types. This
  prevents circular imports. For many 3rd-party plugin developers, this means
  most typical types and formats are available within a single import.
- Plugin naming takes one of two approaches, typically:
   * The name matches the source tool being wrapped (e.g. ``cutadapt``).
   * The name is some generic descriptor, like ``diversity`` or ``taxa``.
- Action naming typically takes one of two approaches:
   * The name matches a subcommand or method on the source tool being wrapped.
   * The name is a generic descriptor, and typically is written as a verb (but
     not exclusively).
