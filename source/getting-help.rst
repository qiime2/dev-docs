Getting Help
============

These documents are a great place to get started, but we know that sometimes
you just need to talk to another human! We encourage developer discussion in
the (aptly) named "`Developer discussion`_" category on the `QIIME 2 Forum`_.
If you are stuck, don't understand a concept, found a bug, or for more general
or broad dev-related discussions, peek your head in and say "Hello"!

We also have issue trackers on GitHub for all of the `QIIME 2 repositories`_.
These repositories are split out into subprojects like:

- `The QIIME 2 Framework`_
- `Interfaces`_
- `Plugins`_

You are welcome to open a bug report or a feature request on the **relevant
repository**, if you wish. If you are unsure as to where to open an issue, then
the `QIIME 2 Forum`_ is the right place for you to ask, we will help point you
in the right direction!
