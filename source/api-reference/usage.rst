Usage API
=========

The Usage API provides an interface-agnostic way for QIIME 2 plugin
developers to define examples of how to use their plugin’s actions. This
enables the programmatic generation of examples for all QIIME 2 interfaces,
eliminating the need to maintain specific examples for multiple interfaces.
