Archive Versions

As QIIME 2 has developed, the structure of QIIME 2 :term:`archives<Archive>` has evolved.
The earliest Archives did not capture :term:`Provenance` metadata at all,
and were generally simpler than recent versions.

This page describes each historical version of the QIIME 2 Archive format,
and may be useful to developers whose code depends on guarantees made by that format
(`source code <https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/blob/master/qiime2/core/archive/>`_).

For general information about the structure of current QIIME 2 Archives, see :doc:`archive`.
For a detailed description of the part of an Archive which holds Provenance data, see :doc:`provenance`.
