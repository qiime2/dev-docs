Decentralized Provenance Tracking
=================================
.. contents::
   :local:

QIIME 2 provides automatic, integrated, and decentralized tracking of analysis
metadata, including information about the host system, the computing
environment, Actions performed, parameters passed, primary sources cited, and
more. We describe all of this information about "how an analysis was
performed" as "provenance".

The notion of a QIIME 2 :term:`Result` is central here. Whenever an
:term:`Action` is performed on some data with QIIME 2, the framework
captures relevant metadata about the action and environment as a :term:`Result`,
backed by an :term:`Archive`. If that Result is saved as a ``.qza`` or ``.qzv``,
the captured provenance data persists within that zip archive.
:ref:`provenance-structure` contains a detailed discussion of the
file structure which holds provenance metadata.

This decentralized approach to provenance capture,
in which every QIIME 2 Result's provenance is packaged with the Result itself,
prevents accidental mis-association of Results with inaccurate or outdated provenance records.
It is natural for centralized approaches to provenance tracking,
like scripts or lab notebooks to require changes and updates during investigation.
In contrast, the provenance captured within a QIIME 2 Archive will always describe
the way that Archive was actually created.

This approach is a form of *retrospective* provenance capture.
Unlike *prospective* provenance,
in which a script, work plan, or notes are used to document "what will be done",
retrospective provenance documents what *actually occurred*,
supporting a more complete and accurate recording of an analysis.

.. note::
   *When and if* Results are saved as ``.qza`` or ``.qzv`` zip archives is interface-defined.
   For example, results are saved automatically by ``q2cli`` every time a user runs a command.
   They must be saved manually by users of the `Artifact API <https://docs.qiime2.org/2021.4/interfaces/artifact-api/>`_.
   This allows API uses to reduce I/O, and keeps things simpler for CLI users.

Why Capture Provenance Data?
----------------------------

Provenance gives QIIME 2 users, paper reviewers, and developers valuable
tools for zero-cost documentation, study validation and reproduction,
workflow pipelining, and software maintenance and repair.

Among the benefits of this model are:

- Analyses are *fully* reproducible.
- Analyses self-document, reducing the need for investigator notetaking.
  For example, q2view produces `directed provenance graphs. <https://view.qiime2.org/provenance/?src=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.qiime2.org%2F2021.4%2Fdata%2Ftutorials%2Fmoving-pictures%2Fcore-metrics-results%2Funweighted_unifrac_emperor.qzv>`__
  QIIME 2 Artifacts bring their citations with them.
  Methods-section text could theoretically be generated
  from a collection of QIIME 2 Artifacts.
- Analyses are replay-able.
  The QIIME 2 team is developing functionality to generate executable scripts
  from prior results, simplifying the repetition of analyses.
- In the unlikely event of a data integrity bug, problematic combinations of hardware,
  environment, Action, and parameters can be investigated effectively.
  Impacted results can be programatically identified, and could be programatically
  correctable in some cases.

By capturing provenance metadata at the level of Actions/Results, QIIME 2
provenance is both host- and interface-agnostic. In other words, a QIIME 2
analysis can be performed across various host systems, using whatever interfaces
the user prefers, without compromising the validity of the analysis or the
provenance. The Result of every step in the analysis contains its own
unique history.

What Provenance Data is Captured?
---------------------------------

In order to focus on provenance data, we will consider a relatively simple example
QIIME 2 Archive structure, with limited non-provenance content. Below the
outer :term:`UUID` directory, this :term:`Artifact` holds the data it
produced in a ``data`` directory (:ref:`data-goes-in-data`), and a few "clerical"
files treated at greater length in :doc:`/storing-data/archive`.

.. figure:: ../img/provenance/whole_archive.svg
   :alt: Simplified representation of all files within one Archive,
         emphasizing how an Archive holds provenance for an arbitrary number of Actions

All that's left to discuss is the ``provenance/`` directory. In the diagram
above, we use a blue "multiple-files" icon to represent the collection of
provenance data associated with one single QIIME 2 action. When this icon appears
directly within ``provenance/`` the files describe the "current" :term:`Result`.
All remaining icons appear within the ``artifacts/`` subdirectory. These file
collections describe all "parent" Results used in the creation of the current Result,
and are housed in directories named with their respective UUIDs.

.. figure:: ../img/provenance/prov_files.svg
   :alt: A legend indicating how we abbreviate one action's provenance records
         with a single "multiple-files" icon.

With the exception of the current Result (whose provenance lives in ``provenance/``,
every Action is captured in a directory titled with the Action's :term:`UUID`. 
That directory contains:

- ``VERSION``: :ref:`identifying-an-archive`
- ``metadata.yaml``: :ref:`metadata-yaml`
- ``citations.bib``: all citations related to the run Action, in
  `bibtex format <https://www.bibtex.com/g/bibtex-format/>`_.
  (This includes "passthrough" citations like those registered to transformers,
  regardless of the plugin where they are registered.)
- ``action/action.yaml``: a YAML description of the Action and its environment.
  The good stuff!
- [optional] ``action/metadata.tsv`` or other data files:
  data captured to provide additional Action context

The ``action.yaml`` file
````````````````````````

Here, we'll do a deep dive into the contents of a sample visualization's ``action.yaml``.
These files are broken into three top-level sections, in this order:

- execution: the Execution ID and runtime of the Action that created this Result
- action: Action type, plugin, action, inputs, parameters, etc.
- environment: a non-comprehensive description of the system and
  the QIIME 2 environment where this action was executed

The specific example shown below is avaiable for your perusal at 
`q2view <https://view.qiime2.org/provenance/?src=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.qiime2.org%2F2021.4%2Fdata%2Ftutorials%2Fmoving-pictures%2Fcore-metrics-results%2Funweighted_unifrac_emperor.qzv>`__.
Click on the bottom square in the provenance graph, 
or download and open the archive to peruse the YAML file itself.

The execution block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
High-level information about this action and its run time.

.. code-block:: YAML

   execution:
      uuid: 3611a0c1-e5c5-4308-ac92-ebb5968ebafb
      runtime:
          start: 2021-04-21T14:42:16.469998-07:00
          end: 2021-04-21T14:42:21.080381-07:00
          duration: 4 seconds, and 610383 microseconds

- Datetimes are formatted as
  `ISO 8601 timestamps <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isoformat>`_.
- The ``uuid`` field captured here is a UUID V4 *representing this Action*,
  and *not the Result it produced*.

.. _`Unique IDs`:

.. note:: **Unique IDs**

   There are many elements of provenance that require unique IDs,
   to help us keep track of different aspects of an analysis.
   All Archives with provenance have separate Result and Execution IDs
   (the ``uuid`` s in ``metadata.yaml`` and ``action.yaml`` respectively).
   This allows us to manage the common case where one Action produces multiple Results.

   Artifacts produced by QIIME 2 Pipelines have an additional ``alias-of`` uuid,
   allowing interfaces to display provenance in terms of Pipelines
   (rather than displaying all of the pipeline's "nested" inner Actions).
   This enables a view of provenance that better reflects the user experience of pipelines,
   displaying them as single blocks,
   rather than as the full chain of inner Actions which the user generally does not specify directly.

   Terminal pipeline Results are redundant "aliases" of "real" Results nested within the pipeline.
   The ``alias-of`` uuid in the terminal/"alias" Result points to this "real" inner result.
   Details in `Pipeline Provenance`_.

   The ``unweighted_unifrac_emperor.qzv`` described here has three different IDs:

   - The Result UUID, in ``metadata.yaml`` is unique to this Result
   - The Execution UUID, in ``action.yaml`` ``execution`` is unique to this Pipeline's current execution,
     and present in all pipeline Archives produced during this execution.
     All Results from a given run of ``core-metrics-phylogenetic`` share this ID.
   - The ``alias-of`` UUID, in ``action.yaml`` ``action`` is the Result UUID of the
     "inner" Visualization created during pipeline execution that is aliased by this Result

   We chose to use `v4 UUIDs <https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html>`_ for our unique IDs,
   but there is nothing special about them that couldn't be handled by a different unique identifier scheme.
   They're just IDs.

.. _`action-block`:

The action block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Details about the action, including action and plugin names, inputs and parameters

.. code-block:: YAML

   action:
      type: pipeline
      plugin: !ref 'environment:plugins:diversity'
      action: core_metrics_phylogenetic
      inputs:
      -   table: 34b07e56-27a5-4f03-ae57-ff427b50aaa1
      -   phylogeny: a10d5d44-62c7-4322-afbe-c9811bcaa3e6
      parameters:
      -   sampling_depth: 1103
      -   metadata: !metadata 'metadata.tsv'
      -   n_jobs_or_threads: 1
      output-name: unweighted_unifrac_emperor
      alias-of: 2adb9f00-a692-411d-8dd3-a6d07fc80a01

- The type field describes the *type of the Action*:
  a :term:`Method`, :term:`Visualizer`, or :term:`Pipeline`.
- The plugin field describes the plugin which registered the Action,
  details about which can be found in ``action.yaml``'s ``environment:plugins`` section.
  ``!ref`` is a custom YAML tag defined
  `here <https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/blob/6d8932eda130d4a9356f977fece2e252c135d0b9/qiime2/core/archive/provenance.py#L84>`_,
  Generally, these custom tags provide a way to express a structure not easily described by basic YAML.
- Inputs lists the registered names of all :term:`inputs<Input>` to the Action,
  as well as the UUIDs of the passed inputs.
  Note the distinction between inputs and parameters.
- Parameters lists registered parameter names, and the user-passed (or selected default) values.
- ``output-name`` is the name assigned to this Action's output *at registration*,
  which can be useful when determining which of an Action's multiple outputs a file represents.
  (This does not capture the user-passed filename.)
- ``alias-of``: an optional field, present if the Action is the terminal result of a QIIME 2 :term:`Pipeline`,
  this value is the UUID of the "inner" result which this pipeline result aliases.
  See maintainer note above for details.


The environment block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A non-comprehensive description of the computing environment in which this Action was run.
It is not uncommon for QIIME 2 analyses to be run through multiple user interfaces, on multiple systems.
For this reason, per-Action logging of system characteristics is useful.

- ``platform``: the operating system and version used to run the Action. For VMs, this is the client OS.
- ``python``: python version details, as captured by ``sys.version``
- ``framework``: details about the QIIME 2 version used to perform this Action
- ``plugin``: the QIIME 2 plugin, its version, and registered source web site
- ``python-packages``: package names and version numbers for all packages in the global ``working_set``
  of the active Python distribution, as collected by
  `pkg_resources <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#workingset-objects>`_.

.. admonition:: Maintainer Note
   :class: maintainer-note

   QIIME 2 currently captures only Python packages data, but we plan to expand this
   to include all relevant packages in the environment regardless of language.

Pipeline Provenance
-------------------

As discussed in :ref:`the note <Unique IDs>` above, :term:`Pipeline` provenance is more complex than
the provenance of other Actions.
Most Pipelines wrap one or more :term:`Methods<Method>` or :term:`Visualizers<Visualizer>`.
Pipeline users are often concerned primarily with ease of use and interpretation,
rather than the fine-grained details of the Actions "nested" within the Pipeline.
With this in mind, interfaces may choose to abstract away nested Actions,
displaying only the Pipeline used to run those Actions.

q2view works in this way, and the simple graph shown in our `provenance example <https://view.qiime2.org/provenance/?src=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.qiime2.org%2F2021.4%2Fdata%2Ftutorials%2Fmoving-pictures%2Fcore-metrics-results%2Funweighted_unifrac_emperor.qzv>`__
is the result of hiding ten nested Actions from view behind the two pipelines that use them.
The user sees only five of the fifteen captured Results, each of which they ran themselves.
Because the bottom two are pipelines, this view simply but completely represents the provenance
of the Archive being viewed.

This is possible because QIIME 2 captures redundant "terminal" pipeline outputs
that alias the "real" pipeline outputs nested in provenance.
These terminal outputs have the same :term:`Semantic Type` as the Results they alias,
but capture provenance details at the scope of the Pipeline,
rather than at the scope of the Method of Visualizer they alias.

Pipeline provenance by example
```````````````````````````````

This Artifact's root-level ``metadata.yaml`` tells us it's a Visualization:

.. code-block:: YAML

   uuid: 87058ae3-e168-4e2f-a416-81b130d538c3
   type: Visualization
   format: null


The root-level ``action.yaml`` file tells us that this is the (terminal) result of a Pipeline
(and not of a Visualizer).
The inputs are the UUIDs passed by the user to the Pipeline.
The parameters, too, are linked to the Pipeline, and not to the nested Visualizer.
Finally, we see the ``alias-of`` key,
whose value is the UUID of the nested "real" Visualization aliased by this terminal output.

.. code-block:: YAML

   action:
       type: pipeline
       plugin: !ref 'environment:plugins:diversity'
       action: core_metrics_phylogenetic
       inputs:
       -   table: 34b07e56-27a5-4f03-ae57-ff427b50aaa1
       -   phylogeny: a10d5d44-62c7-4322-afbe-c9811bcaa3e6
       parameters:
       -   sampling_depth: 1103
       -   metadata: !metadata 'metadata.tsv'
       -   n_jobs_or_threads: 1
       output-name: unweighted_unifrac_emperor
       alias-of: 2adb9f00-a692-411d-8dd3-a6d07fc80a01

We can use this alias-of URL to drill down into ``provenance/artifacts/2adb9.../``
to find the ``action.yaml`` of the aliased Visualization. Here,
The action type is a ``visualizer``, and the inputs and parameters are those
passed to the *Visualizer* within the Pipeline.
Notably, neither the Visualizer node shown below, nor its PCoA input,
are visible in the q2view graph linked above,
because they are neither inputs to nor terminal outputs from their pipeline.

.. code-block:: YAML

   action:
       type: visualizer
       plugin: !ref 'environment:plugins:emperor'
       action: plot
       inputs:
       -   pcoa: 93224813-ed5d-42b5-a983-cd4015db31da
       parameters:
       -   metadata: !metadata 'metadata.tsv'
       -   custom_axes: null
       -   ignore_missing_samples: false
       -   ignore_pcoa_features: false
       output-name: visualization



Pipeline Provenance Takeaways
`````````````````````````````

- All Results used in producing an Archive are captured in that Archive's provenance,
  even "inner" pipeline results. Each Result has its own normal provenance directory.
- "Terminal" pipeline outputs are redundant aliases, mirroring inner Actions.
- Different terminal outputs from the same pipeline will (generally) have different alias-of's,
  *because they are aliasing different inner nodes*.
  E.g a Visualization aliases a Visualization, while the terminal PCoA results point to the inner PCoA results,
  and these inner Results have different UUIDs.
- Pipelines may wrap pipelines, so an arbitrary number of levels of nesting and aliasing are possible.
  Tools that aim to work with nested provenance will likely have to traverse from the terminal node.
  The traversal algorithm can be found on `github <https://github.com/qiime2/dev-docs/pull/44#discussion_r673329452>`__.
- Inner "nested" pipeline Results are normal Results, and may be used as inputs to other nested Actions,
  or may be aliased by terminal pipeline results.
  The only "special" thing happening with pipelines is the aliasing of terminal pipeline Results.
